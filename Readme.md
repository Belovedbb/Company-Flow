  Thymeleaf is used as Company-Flow view resolver in conjuction with frontend technologies, the controller only does the routing from the view to the application module.

* Common: Handle common utilities used by all Company-Flow modules
* Starter: Starter mechnism for Company-Flow. The configuration of application contex of spring happens in this module.
